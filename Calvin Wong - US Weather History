```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight/master/data-raw/us-weather-history/KCLT.csv"
temp <- read.csv(url, header = TRUE)
```

###Let's see how the dateset looks

```{r}
str(temp)
```

###Let's run some queries

Here I want to see what record temperatures were over 103 degrees.

```{r}
filter(temp, record_max_temp > 103)
```

Here I want to see what precipitation was like and arranged the data in descending order by record_percipitation.

```{r}
select(temp, date, average_precipitation, record_precipitation) %>% arrange(desc(record_precipitation))
```

Let's find the average record temperatures and order by descending average record temperature.

```{r}
mutate(temp, record_average_temp = (record_min_temp + record_min_temp)/2) %>% 
  select(date, record_average_temp) %>% 
  arrange(desc(record_average_temp))
```
